# ANN_Churn-Modelling
A churn model is a mathematical representation of how churn impacts your business. Churn calculations are built on existing data (the number of customers who left your service during a given time period). A predictive churn model extrapolates on this data to show future potential churn rates.

This project predicts customer churn using Artificial Neural Network.
